# rock-paper-scissors
This program runs a best-of-five game of rock, paper scissors between the user and the computer.
When the page loads, the user is prompted to type in either "rock", "paper", or "scissors".
The input is case insensitive, and if invalid or no input is given, the user is prompted again.
For each round, the player's choice is evaluated against the computer's random choice, and the winner gets a point.
The result of each round is printed to the console, with the updated scores.
A tie results in neither player getting a point.
When either the player or the computer reaches a score of 3, the game ends and the winner is announced.
